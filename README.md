# Lando Statamic Starter
A starter repository for building a Statamic local dev environment

## Requirements

You need to have [Lando](https://lando.dev/download/) installed 
which you can download [here](https://lando.dev/download/).

## To run

```shell
git clone git@github.com:stiknoltz/lando-statamic-starter.git
```

Or just as good, you can download the .zip file using the Code dropdown above. 
This prevents you from having a this .git repo and allows you to start a new 
repository should you wish. 

Following that, just drop into your new directory. 

```shell
cd lando-statamic-starter
```

And start up Lando.

```shell
lando start
```
